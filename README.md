# Coffee Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of coffee sales data using Excel. The primary goal of this project is to analyze and present the sales data in a meaningful way through various Excel functions and visualization tools. Using Excel's basic features like VLOOKUP, INDEX, IF statements, pivot tables, slicers, and charts, I have developed key insights into the coffee sales.

### Key Features of the Project:
- **Total Sales by Country**: Summarizing the total sales figures based on countries.
- **Top 5 Customers with Highest Sales**: Identifying the customers contributing the most to the sales.
- **Year-wise Sales of Different Coffee Types**: Tracking and analyzing how sales of various coffee types have performed over the years.

### Excel Functions & Features Used:
- **VLOOKUP**: To retrieve related data from different parts of the dataset.
- **INDEX**: For extracting values from specific rows and columns.
- **IF Statements**: Used for conditional analysis and decision-making.
- **Pivot Tables**: To summarize large datasets and provide insights based on different categories.
- **Slicers**: For easy filtering of data in pivot tables to focus on specific regions or criteria.
- **Bar Charts & Line Charts**: To visualize sales trends and comparisons.
- **Timeline**: To visualize year-over-year sales of different coffee types.

## Files Included:
1. **Raw Data File**: Contains the original dataset for coffee sales.
2. **Expected Result and Dashboard File**: This file includes the final analysis with visualizations (charts, pivot tables, and slicers) as well as the expected results.

## Instructions to Use:
1. Open the `Raw Data File` in Excel.
2. Apply the same Excel functions used in the `Expected Result and Dashboard File` to replicate the final analysis.
3. Review the results to analyze total sales by country, top 5 customers with the highest sales, and year-wise sales of different coffee types.

## Purpose of This Project:
This project helps in understanding how Excel functions and tools can be used to efficiently analyze sales data and present it visually. It showcases how basic Excel skills can be applied to real-world datasets for valuable insights.

## Tools Used:
- **Microsoft Excel** (for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization)
